                            Mason Filippi, Harry Gottsacker, Bryson Morris and Mark Wilkins, representing Team Americas
                            has won the TCR class of the 2024 Nürburgring 24 Hours, giving Hyundai victory for the fourth
                            consecutive year at the race.</p>
                          <p class="press__paragraph">The quartet crossed the line after completing 44 laps of the 25km
                            track at the end of a race where running was severely curtailed by heavy fog that limited
                            Sunday running to a handful of laps under Safety Car conditions after a red flag that lasted
                            more than 14 hours. They headed a historic 1-2-3 in the class in the first year Hyundai
                            Motorsport has entered a trio of cars into the race. Team Europe, the defending class winning
                            driver Mikel Azcona, Marc Basseng and Manuel Lauck. Team China - Hongwei Cao, Zhang Zhendong,
                            Rainey He and Andy Yan completed the podium in third aboard the #832 ELANTRA N TCR.</p>
                          <p class="press__paragraph">The weekend started well for the team of Bryan Herta Autosport
                            drivers. Nürburgring 24 Hours debutant Morris snatched class pole away from his European
                            team-mates with a superb lap late in the final qualifying session on Friday afternoon.</p>
                          <p class="press__paragraph">Team Americas and Team Europe started the race side-by-side, but it
                            was Manuel Lauck who made the best start in slippery conditions - his experience at the
                            Nordschleife helping him take the lead and build an early advantage. A strong double stint by
                            Lauck and then a turn by Mikel Azcona had the car inside the top 40 overall before the car was
                            forced into the garage to change a driveshaft. The time lost dropped the car from the lead of
                            the TCR class to third, though Marc Basseng put in a double stint of his own to start climbing
                            back up the order. With Lauck back behind the wheel Team Europe were on the cusp of retaking
                            second in class from Team China when the race was red flagged seven hours into the race at
                            23:22 local time after a heavy fog descended over the circuit, causing a stoppage for safety
                            reasons.</p>
                          <p class="press__paragraph">It was not until 13:30 on Sunday afternoon that the race restarted
                            with five laps all run behind the Safety Car, with all three ELANTRA N TCR teams on the same
                            lap. However, racing never resumed as the lingering fog forced the decision to call an early
                            finish with an hour left of the original 24. The premature end confirmed Team Americas as
                            victors, with no time for Lauck - driving for Team Europe at the time - to complete the
                            comeback. Still, the Hyundai Motorsport celebrated the podium sweep in class at the end of
                            particularly challenging edition of the Nürburgring 24 Hours.</p>

                            Front class victory well. Their Fastback N Cup Car was leading the category once more after an
                            opening stint by Michael Bohrer, when Jens Dralle pitted with a puncture. The delay dropped
                            them to third in in class, but Marcus Willhardt and then Gyumin Kim brought the car up to
                            second before the contest was suspended. Like their TCR counterparts, the ending to the race
                            prevented them from launching completing the final stage of their recovery, leaving them

                            mistakes and brought the cars to the finish. Mason, Harry, Bryson and Mark of Team Americas in
                            the #831 had a very consistent race which was the Page 2key to their success in the end, and
                            we know they could also be quick after Bryson took pole position from Qualifying. Manuel Lauck
                            had an amazing first stint in mixed conditions to start building a good lead, but a technical
                            issue - even though it was well handled by the team - would prove costly when the red flag
                            stopped their comeback. Team China did an excellent job in the difficult situation, even as
                            the least experienced line-up from our squad to complete the podium. It is unfortunate that
                            after many months of preparation, including car preparation specifically for this event that
                            the race was stopped due to weather conditions. It is something we can't control but
                            nevertheless we have achieved an historical 1 2 3 in TCR class. Our drivers stayed out of the

                            TCR for Team Americas. It was a difficult weekend for me, coming back for a second weekend in
                            the TCR car at the Nürburgring for the first time at the 24 Hours. In Qualifying 3 I was able
                            to set the pole time in the TCR class but we had a bit of a surprise on the grid when the rain
                            came down so we swapped tyres at the last second. The start of the race was the first time in
                            the rain at the Nürburgring for me so it was a super difficult first stint but I was able to
                            get through it. I got back in the car at night in the lead, but there was some fog - later
                            we’d find out that was bad news. I drove for about an hour in pretty difficult conditions. It
                            was a drying track with a dry line in most places but wet in others and the fog getting
                            heavier and heavier with the eventual red flag. We were just able to go back out for five laps
                            behind the Safety Car. Unfortunately, we couldn’t race to the end but still super happy to
                            take the win."</p>
                          <p class="press__paragraph">Marc Basseng said: "We had a really, really good start. We could
                            take over P1 immediately and extend our gap, I think nearly to eight minutes. Unfortunately,
                            we had a technical problem - a driveshaft boot which came off, maybe cause by some debris on
                            the track because there were a lot of crashes going on. We lost around 15 minutes, but then we
                            were really fast in tricky conditions but in the end the weather caused the red flag which
                            lasted for a many, many hours. At the restart we were back on the lead lap, just 14 seconds
                            behind the Team Americas car, but unfortunately the fog was so heavy that it was too dangerous
                            to restart the race. I’m sure if we had gone back to green, we had a good chance for us to
                            take the lead back but in the end it’s a 1-2-3 for Hyundai Motorsport which is a huge
                            achievement."</p>

                            toughest race in the world and this year it might have been more difficult than ever. We faced
                            difficult, changing conditions. It was raining, it became dry, then foggy and through it all
                            we tried to do our best to get the result for us and the team and finally we did it 1-2-3 for
                            Hyundai Motorsport and the ELANTRA N TCR. I’m really proud to have been part of the team."</p>
